# Epitomesh: the HypderOS shell

## Notes

- Epitomesh was inspired by "Squish" - the Squire shell originally conceived cerca 2020. This one is a little more domain-specific and ad-hoc, which I hope will be practical and expedient.
- in its current form, it is a hack and should not be built upon seriously without extensive refactoring. But it's better than install.sh
